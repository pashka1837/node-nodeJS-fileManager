# node-nodeJS-fileManager
RS_School File Manager Task 
Be aware, functionality for reading pathes to files or folders with spaces in their name - wasn`t implemented! 
For example command 'cd C:/"\bring me tea"\'   will give you "Invalid input"!
If you enter full path instead new_filename in ' rn path_to_file full_path_with_new_name ' file will be renamed and moved to entered path!
COMPRESS AND DECOMPRESS: in "path_to_destination" you can enter eather path or path and new filename and extention!
